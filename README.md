This-and-their-CSP
==================

Studying Communicating Sequential Processes on top of basically single-threaded asynchronous non-blocking and therefore callback based systems.

I started this repository in 2014 to see if I could jot down some of my own experience (and what i could find) of systems like the above.

Now, in 2025 I notice that I might have blogged some about relating themes, see https://www.teigfam.net/oyvind/home/technology/. 

I have a feeling that this repository will never be realised. It is therefore perhaps pending a removal.
